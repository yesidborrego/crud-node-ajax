# CRUD NodeJS - Ajax

This is a project created to practice the use of NodeJS with the Express framework, I used Ajax and simulated a connection to the database with an array.

This exercise was taken from [Fazt's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMn28O1sQGochG94HdlthbA), which I recommend.
